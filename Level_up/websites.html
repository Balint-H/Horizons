                <span class="section-heading-lower">Start Bootstrap</span>
              </h2>
              <p>Start Bootstrap was picked for its easy to use, modular themes, as well as its extensive tutorials. Notepad++ was used to edit .css and .html files, as it is a great environment for a wide variety of languages/formats to make quick changes. Git and Github was used for version control.</p>

			  <ol>
				<li>Find the availability for several candidate domain names using registrar search tools to find conract prices, and evaluate which top level domain to use</li>
				<li>Once a suitable domain is found register it with the appropriate company</li>
				<li>Find and hire company to host DNS records (could be the same)</li>

                <span class="section-heading-upper">What makes a</span>
                <span class="section-heading-lower">Good Website?</span>
              </h2>
			  <p>Important traits:</p>
			  <ul>
				<li>Consistent style</li>
				<li>Easily navigatable UI</li>
				<li>Multiplatform support</li>
				<li>Memorable domain name</li>
			  </ul>
              <p>Furthermore a good website's content is cohesive, and serves a clear focused purpose. Any design choices made should be to communicate and elaborate this theme to the user.</p>
              <br/>
			  <p>A website needs to be accessible in a way that it's accessible to everyone. Disabilities range widely, both on what parts of a person's life they affect and through their extent. The implications of these aren't always apparent for someone living without them, therefore careful considerations need to be made to account for them. Not only is it ethical, and allows us to reach a wider audience, the Equality Act makes it necessary for a service to be accessible to everyone who could use it.</p> <p> These are some of the elements I implemented to make this website more accessible:</p>
			  <ul>
				<li>Visual feedback for interactive elements</li>
				<li>Calm, non highly-stimulating UI</li>
				<li>A sans-serif font, for readability</li>
				<li>Colors were tested with different color-blindness simulating filters to ensure all informance is conveyed to people with the three most common family of colourblindness</li>
				<li>Alt text was added for images for people using screen readers</li>
				<li>Backgrounds and colors for text were chosen to ensure clear contrast for the necessary information</li>
			  </ul>

			  <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data protection regulation implemented in the EU since 25 May, 2018. It effectively holds companies accountable for the way they handle personal information, and was catalysed by a series of massive data breaches in recent history. Companies with over 250 employees need documentation of why and how is information collected, and to have taken the necessary steps to secure it. More generally, to be compliant consent needs to be obtained to collect personal data in the first place.</p> <p>Considering our project:</p>
			  <ul>
				<li>No regular and systematic monitoring takes place, and information gathered would need to be anonymised</li>
				<li>Social media links and buttons would only expose our information, users would contact us and give all information out of their own volition.</li>
				<li>Should later on personal information be gathered for reasonable purposes (e.g. a newsletter) users would be provided with a record of all information stored, which would be removed at the request of the user. Any services, such as a newsletter, would be positive opt-in.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <br/>
			  <p>Platforms such as Google adwords provide easy ways of targeted advertising. Collaboration/giveaways with social influencers is a good way to reach an audience, as long as the channel's viewers would be interested in the product. Similarly free tables could be provided for bars or youth centers, where fans of tablefootball are better represented. Search engine optimization is a set of design principles that would increase the chance of users finding our service through search engines.</p>
			  <br/>
			  <p>The site should feature an orders site, where visitors could place orders for shipments. A secure method for taking payments needs to be implemented, perhaps using an existing platform such as Shopify or Paypal. Videos should be added with the table in action. A social media page could be set up to gain exposure. Our product could be sold on other e-commerce marketplaces to stock our product, such as Liberty Games or Amazon.</p>
