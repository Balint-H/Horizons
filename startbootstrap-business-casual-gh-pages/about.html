              </h2>
              <p>Table football is a simple, accessible game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for generations. It has been around at least since the 20th century, with patents going back to as early as 1923. Despite this the game itself has remained more or less unchanged. All the hundreds of variations, including outliers like miniature or massive novelty ones, consist of the same 5 core elements: the ball, poles, players, goals and the table frame â€“ but not much else. </p>
              <p class="mb-0">The game's popularity can be credited to its simplicity, but it also gives rise to some problems. One of these is that the game lacks strategic depth, relying almost entirely on skill. This also means that a skilled player will handily beat even groups of beginners without being challenged. Furthermore there are common technical issues that can negatively effect the game, such as unlevel surfaces or the ball getting stuck in a corner.</p>
			  <p class="mb-0">We believe that the game of table football is limited in its current form and can be augmented by the addition of a few new features, which will add excitement to the game without robbing it of its wonderful simplicity. The goals of our project is to make elements of the game customisable, as well as self adapting to challenge all players.</p>

              </h2>
              <p>It is not unusual for a more experienced player to win 10:0, so much so that there is a common rule obligating the losers in this case to crawl under the table. While this is a fun tradition, it is reasonable to imagine how both players could enjoy a more even match-up. The above described tilt control system allows changing the inclination of the playing field. This in turn results in one team being favoured by gravity, as their opponent is forced to fight a literal uphill battle. Normally this is the exact situation the tilt control system should work to avoid, however this can be exploited to adapt for a discrepancy between the skill levels of players. Alternatively player handicap can be set by playing with different amounts of figurines, similar to how the board game Go handles skill differences. Asymmetric team formations can change up how the game is played, letting the players experiment with different tactics and give way to emergent gameplay based on player choice.</p>
